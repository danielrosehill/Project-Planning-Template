# Verbatim Transcripts

This directory holds raw, unedited transcripts generated by `transcribe_audio_raw`.

These preserve:
- Filler words (um, uh, like, you know)
- False starts and corrections
- Repetitions
- Exact spoken content

Useful for reference when the cleaned version may have lost nuance.
